Task 9 - due12/11/2024

Decompose your domain model into aggregates. Follow the decomposition guidelines given at the lectures.

See the template for the report
https://tiny.cc/asd-template-services 

What to do
1. Reuse your use case model from final task 1. Use these scenarios or user/job stories as a basis for event storming.
2. Run an event storming session as a team. Come up with events, assign them to aggregates and connect to commands given by actors. Compose at least one process out of events. Check if events or domain classes are missing in the domain model.
3. Update your domain model with new events and/or classes, ensure that correct DDD stereotypes are given to model elements. 
4. Decompose the domain model into aggregates and draw a logical UML2 domain diagram or a ER diagram.
5. Check that decomposition constraints hold. (i.e. no shared singletons between aggregates)

NOTE: do not forget to reify long-running processes as distinct entities/roots
NOTE: at least one aggregate per team member is needed.
HINT: do not assign the same class to several aggregates

Results of the task:
- Events canvas and other results of event storming
- Updated domain model
- Logical models of the aggregates
- Report with slides
