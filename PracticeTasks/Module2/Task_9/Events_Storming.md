### **1. Key User/Job Stories and Use Cases for Event Storming**
1. **Publishing and Deploying a Model (ML Engineer)**
   - An ML Engineer publishes a trained model and deploys it for production use.

2. **Sending and Validating API Requests (API Consumer)**
   - An API Consumer sends a request, which goes through authentication, authorization, and caching.

3. **Load Balancing and Log Collection (DevOps Engineer and Security Specialist)**
   - Load balancing is configured to handle API traffic effectively, while logs are collected for monitoring and security.

### **2. Identifying Events, Commands, and Aggregates**
#### **Scenario 1: Publishing and Deploying a Model**
   **Actors:**
   - **ML Engineer**

   **Commands and Events:**
   - **Command:** `PublishModel`  
       **Event:** `ModelPublished` – signals that the model has been made available in the repository.

   - **Command:** `ContainerizeModel`  
       **Event:** `ModelContainerized` – signals the creation of a container image for the model.

   - **Command:** `DeployContainerToK8sCluster`  
       **Event:** `ModelDeployed` – the model container is deployed to Kubernetes.

   **Aggregates:**
   - **Model** – holds model metadata, version, and status.
   - **Container** – stores the container configuration and status.
   - **Deployment** – tracks the deployment state, replicas, and resources in the Kubernetes environment.

#### **Scenario 2: Sending and Validating API Requests**
   **Actors:**
   - **API Consumer**

   **Commands and Events:**
   - **Command:** `SendRequest`  
       **Event:** `RequestReceived` – triggers the receipt of a new API request.

   - **Command:** `AuthenticateRequest`  
       **Event:** `RequestAuthenticated` – confirms that the request was successfully authenticated.

   - **Command:** `ValidateRequest`  
       **Event:** `RequestValid` – verifies that the request structure matches the OpenAPI schema.

   - **Command:** `CacheResponse`  
       **Event:** `ResponseCached` – stores the response in the cache for future requests.

   **Aggregates:**
   - **Request** – includes authentication, authorization status, and request data.
   - **ResponseCache** – manages cached responses for efficient reuse.

#### **Scenario 3: Load Balancing and Log Collection**
   **Actors:**
   - **DevOps Engineer** and **Security Specialist**.

   **Commands and Events:**
   - **Command:** `ConfigureLoadBalancing`  
       **Event:** `LoadBalancingConfigured` – sets up the load balancing rules and assigns resources.

   - **Command:** `CollectLogs`  
       **Event:** `LogsCollected` – collects logs from API and Kubernetes activities for analysis.

   **Aggregates:**
   - **LoadBalancer** – defines load balancing configuration and status.
   - **Log** – stores collected log data for auditing and monitoring.

### **3. Process Composition: API Request Handling Process**
This process involves multiple events triggered by commands, following a sequential flow to handle API requests and responses.
**Process:** **API Request Handling**
1. **Event:** `RequestReceived`  
   **Command:** `AuthenticateRequest`

2. **Event:** `RequestAuthenticated`  
   **Command:** `AuthorizeRequest`

3. **Event:** `RequestAuthorized`  
   **Command:** `ValidateRequest`

4. **Event:** `RequestValidated`  
   **Command:** `CacheResponse`

5. **Event:** `ResponseCached`  
   **Command:** `SendResponse`

6. **Event:** `ResponseSent` – notifies that the response was sent to the API Consumer.

### **4. Missing Events or Domain Classes in the Domain Model**
During this analysis, a few additional events and classes emerged as necessary for a complete domain model:
1. **Events:**
   - `ResponseSent` – represents the final step in handling an API request, confirming that the response has been delivered to the consumer.
   - `DeploymentStatusUpdated` – tracks the live status of model deployments, important for monitoring and scaling.

2. **Domain Classes:**
   - **CachePolicy** – defines caching rules for specific API responses.
   - **AuthenticationToken** – used to manage authorization and session information.
   - **K8sResource** – a class to generalize and track Kubernetes resources used in deployments, services, and configurations.
