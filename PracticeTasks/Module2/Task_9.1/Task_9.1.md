Elicit addressable resources and compose microservices. Follow the guidelines given at the lectures

See the template for the report
https://tiny.cc/asd-template-components 

What to do:
1. Reuse your aggregates model from Task 9.
2. Elicit addressable resources for each of the aggregates and list responsibilities assigned to these resources.
3. Devise a microservice for the aggregates, domain services and their resources. Draw a UML2 components diagram or a physical DFD diagram. Fill in the traceability table.
4. Verify that components are connected where interactions take place and if you use DFD - then the relevant information is transferred, see Event storming diagram from the previous task.
5. Propose a set of technologies you would like to use to implement the system. (may submit next week)

NOTE: at least one microservice per team member is needed.
HINT: you do not need to detail the interfaces of the components yet

Results of the task:
- Updated aggregates with a list of available resources
- Component or physical DFD diagram
- Report with slides
