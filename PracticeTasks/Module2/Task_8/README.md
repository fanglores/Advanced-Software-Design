| **Method** | **Advantages** | **Disadvantages** |
|------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **1. Abstract Data Types (ADT)** | - **Modular Structure:** Encapsulating functionality in classes (e.g., for input handling, keyword searching, and output) promotes modularity, making it easier to maintain and expand. | - **Complexity in Overhead:** Defining and maintaining a class-based system with ADTs can introduce complexity, especially for simpler tasks like KWIC, leading to potential over-engineering. |
| | - **Encapsulation:** Each ADT can store data and manage specific responsibilities, reducing dependencies and simplifying debugging. | - **Potentially Slower Performance:** The use of multiple classes and methods can slow down execution, particularly in scenarios with frequent access to shared data or repetitive processing. |
| | - **Ease of Testing:** The encapsulated structure allows isolated testing of each class, making unit testing simpler. | - **Less Direct Data Access:** ADTs may add unnecessary layers of abstraction, making it harder to quickly implement and modify simple operations needed for KWIC. |
| **2. Main/Subroutine (Shared Data)** | - **Simple Implementation:** The main function divides the task into logical subroutines (`input_handler.py`, `kwic_processor.py`, `output_handler.py`), making the code clear and straightforward. | - **Limited Flexibility:** Rigid structure and shared data limit adaptability to new requirements or extensions. |
| | - **Code Readability:** The stepwise data processing and centralized logic in `main.py` make each function easy to test and debug. | - **Limited Scalability:** Difficult to separate processing into independent modules, which may slow down performance with large text inputs. |
| | - **Memory Efficiency:** Shared data eliminates the need to duplicate data across functions. | - **Shared Data Complexity:** Since all functions can modify the data, debugging can be challenging as it is easy to introduce errors. |
| **3. Pipes-and-Filters** | - **Modularity and Flexibility:** Each filter performs a single function (e.g., `InputFilter`, `CircularShiftFilter`, `AlphabetizerFilter`), making it easy to replace or add filters without modifying the pipeline. | - **Integration Complexity:** Creating connections between filters using pipes, as seen with `pipe_input_to_shift` and other links, can be complicated, especially with numerous filters. |
| | - **Parallel Processing:** Filters function as independent threads, allowing faster processing and better scalability for large datasets. | - **Resource-Intensive:** Parallel thread execution and data passing through `Pipe` queues require additional resources, complicating debugging and potentially slowing performance for small data. |
| | - **Minimal Inter-Module Dependency:** Data passing through pipes reduces dependencies between modules, allowing easy expansion and modification. | - **Synchronization Issues:** Stage-by-stage processing can lead to delays, especially in `AlphabetizerFilter` where sorting and handling multiple threads require synchronization. |
| **4. Implicit Invocation (Event-Driven)** | - **Asynchronous and Scalable:** Event-driven and asynchronous design using events (e.g., `TEXT_READ_EVENT`, `CONTEXT_READY_EVENT` in `event_manager.py`) allows flexible addition or removal of handlers. | - **Debugging Challenges:** The asynchronous structure makes it harder to trace the sequence of events and identify errors, particularly when multiple listeners process data simultaneously. |
| | - **Flexible Processing:** New event handlers can be added without modifying the main code, making it easy to extend functionality (e.g., for additional filtering or sorting). | - **High Overhead:** Supporting event-driven interaction through `EventManager` requires additional infrastructure, increasing complexity and resource usage. |
| | - **Ease of Updates:** Components independently respond to events, simplifying updates and allowing dynamic changes to the text processing logic. | - **Asynchronous Processing Delays:** Event-based handling may introduce delays as each handler waits for events, especially when dealing with a high volume of data, as seen with `context_size`. |

#### Summary
For the KWIC task, **Pipes-and-Filters** is the best choice due to its modularity, flexibility, and support for parallel processing. This method allows for easy maintenance and scalability, making it ideal for handling complex or large datasets in KWIC.
