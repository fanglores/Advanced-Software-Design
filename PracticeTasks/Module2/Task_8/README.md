Hereâ€™s a comprehensive comparison of the solutions for Problem A and Problem B using Method 2 (Main/Subroutine with stepwise refinement) and Method 4 (Event-Driven). The comparison table summarizes the criteria you provided, along with justifications and explanations for each solution.

### Comparison Table

|Criteria|Method 2 (Problem A & B)|Method 4 (Problem A & B)|
|---|---|---|
|**a) Easier to change the implementation algorithm**|Changing the algorithm involves modifying the logic within a single file (`main.py`). This can be straightforward but may require careful consideration of interdependencies within the modules.|The event-driven architecture makes it easier to swap out or modify algorithms by adjusting event handlers or adding new ones. Each module can evolve independently as long as events are properly managed.|
|**b) Easier to change data representation**|Changing data representation requires updating the logic across all functions that process data, leading to potential widespread changes in multiple modules.|The modular design allows for easier changes to data representation as each module responds to events independently. Only the event-triggered functions need adjustment.|
|**c) Easier to add additional functions**|Adding functions may require integrating them into the existing control flow and ensuring they interact correctly with existing functions. This can introduce complexity in coordination.|New functions can be easily added as separate event handlers without altering existing code, promoting scalability and reducing risk of side effects.|
|**d) More performant**|Performance is straightforward as the execution is linear, but might be less optimal if the algorithm becomes complex.|While potentially less performant due to event handling overhead, it offers asynchronous capabilities that can enhance performance under certain conditions (e.g., concurrent events).|
|**e) Which solution would you reuse?**|Method 2 may be preferable for simple tasks due to its straightforward linear flow and easier debugging.|Method 4 is more reusable for larger, more complex systems due to its flexibility and modularity, especially when the application may grow in complexity or feature set.|

### Justification and Explanation

1. **Easier to Change Implementation Algorithm**:
    
    - **Method 2**: While you can change algorithms, any inter-module dependencies must be carefully managed.
    - **Method 4**: The event-driven nature means you can adjust or swap out event handlers without affecting the overall system.
2. **Easier to Change Data Representation**:
    
    - **Method 2**: Changing how data is represented can lead to widespread modifications throughout the code, increasing risk and complexity.
    - **Method 4**: Allows adjustments to data representation within individual modules without impacting other parts of the system as long as events are correctly defined.
3. **Easier to Add Additional Functions**:
    
    - **Method 2**: New functions must be integrated into existing logic, which can complicate things if the main flow is intricate.
    - **Method 4**: Functions can be added as separate event handlers, allowing for easy expansion without interfering with existing code.
4. **Performance**:
    
    - **Method 2**: Generally more performant for straightforward tasks as it executes in a linear manner.
    - **Method 4**: While potentially slower due to event handling overhead, it supports scalability and can improve performance through asynchronous processing.
5. **Reusability**:
    
    - **Method 2**: Best for simple tasks that don't require extensive changes.
    - **Method 4**: More suitable for scalable applications or systems expected to evolve over time due to its modular nature.

### Conclusion

Both methods have their advantages and trade-offs, depending on the complexity and needs of the application. Method 2 is straightforward and performant for simple tasks, while Method 4 offers better modularity and scalability for more complex applications.
