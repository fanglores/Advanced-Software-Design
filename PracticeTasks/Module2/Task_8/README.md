### Comparison Table

| **Criteria**                                      | **Method 1 (ADT)**                                                                                                             | **Method 2 (Main/Subroutine)**                                                                                    | **Method 3 (Pipes-and-Filters)**                                                                                           | **Method 4 (Event-Driven)**                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Easier to change the implementation algorithm** | Encapsulation simplifies changes to implementation within data types, but changes in ADT operations may impact all uses.       | Requires modifying logic within a single file, straightforward but with possible interdependencies to manage.     | Changes in one filter can be made without affecting others, as long as the input/output contract remains the same.         | Event-driven structure enables easy swapping or modification of algorithms through event handlers with minimal impact on other parts. |
| **Easier to change data representation**          | Data changes require modifications in the ADT definitions and possibly all dependent modules, making it somewhat cumbersome.   | Data representation changes require updating multiple functions, potentially leading to widespread modifications. | Each filter independently processes data, allowing data representation changes within individual filters with less impact. | Data representation changes are isolated to individual event handlers, making it easier to manage independently.                      |
| **Easier to add additional functions**            | Adding functions is straightforward if they align with the ADT structure, but additional types may require structural changes. | Adding functions requires careful integration into the control flow, which can introduce complexity.              | Adding new filters or stages is straightforward and can be easily inserted into the pipeline.                              | New functions can be added as separate event handlers, promoting easy scalability without modifying existing code.                    |
| **More performant**                               | ADT generally has good performance as each data type operates within controlled, predictable bounds.                           | Linear execution, good for simple and efficient performance in straightforward tasks.                             | Can have performance overhead due to data passing between filters, especially in sequential pipelines.                     | Event handling may introduce overhead, but asynchronous capabilities can enhance performance with concurrent events.                  |
| **Which solution would you reuse?**               | Suitable for problems needing well-defined data structures and operations, where stability is prioritized.                     | Good for simpler tasks due to its linear flow and ease of debugging.                                              | Ideal for systems requiring sequential or parallel transformations, such as data processing pipelines.                     | Best for complex, scalable systems expected to evolve over time due to flexibility and modularity.                                    |

### Justification and Explanation

1. **Easier to Change Implementation Algorithm**
    
    - **Method 1 (ADT)**: ADTs encapsulate data and behavior, so internal changes are straightforward if the external interface remains the same.
    - **Method 3 (Pipes-and-Filters)**: Each filter operates independently, making it possible to adjust algorithms within a filter without impacting others, as long as input/output formats are maintained.
    - **Method 4 (Event-Driven)**: Event-driven structure simplifies algorithm changes by enabling handler adjustments, allowing modular algorithm swapping.
2. **Easier to Change Data Representation**
    
    - **Method 1 (ADT)**: Changing data representations within ADTs requires changes within the ADT and, potentially, all usages, which can be complex if tightly coupled.
    - **Method 3 (Pipes-and-Filters)**: Changes are contained within the specific filters, reducing the impact on the entire system.
    - **Method 4 (Event-Driven)**: Data representation changes can be isolated to the event-triggered functions, minimizing impacts across modules.
3. **Easier to Add Additional Functions**
    
    - **Method 1 (ADT)**: New functions fit naturally if they’re encapsulated within an ADT but may require structural changes for new operations that don’t align with the current types.
    - **Method 3 (Pipes-and-Filters)**: New filters can be added easily to the pipeline, making it simple to extend functionality.
    - **Method 4 (Event-Driven)**: Additional functions can be added as new event handlers, allowing easy expansion and modular scaling.
4. **Performance**
    
    - **Method 1 (ADT)**: ADT has minimal overhead, performing well within the defined types and operations.
    - **Method 3 (Pipes-and-Filters)**: Sequential filters may introduce slight overhead due to the hand-off between filters, but it supports parallelism in pipelines.
    - **Method 4 (Event-Driven)**: While less performant due to event handling, asynchronous processing can boost performance in concurrent settings.
5. **Reusability**
    
    - **Method 1 (ADT)**: Ideal for problems with well-defined data types where stability and encapsulation are important.
    - **Method 3 (Pipes-and-Filters)**: Excellent for tasks requiring data transformation in stages, particularly for sequential or parallel data processing.
    - **Method 4 (Event-Driven)**: Highly reusable in complex, scalable systems due to modularity and adaptability.
