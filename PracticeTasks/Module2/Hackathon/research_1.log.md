# Request
Suggest 4 microservice frameworks from provided md that correspond the following project the best. Self-documenting API gateway. A typical ingress implementation in k8s forwards incoming traffic to a particular application. An improved API Gateway would integrate Single Sign-On, automatic OpenAPI schema generation, request validation and response caching. The goal of the project is to develop such a Kubernetes operator to extend existing ingress implementations to API Gateway. The project should provide means to define API schema using Custom Resource Definitions in K8s directly and generate them from the source code following a set of conventions.. It has features Request Routing
The basic function of K8s Ingress. A reverse proxy directs external traffic to the required specific K8s services.

Load Balancing
Kubernetes handles it natively using K8s Services, but not via Ingress. Typically configured with weight-based settings.

Audit, Logging
Extension of basic Nginx logging. Future integration with log storage and rotation tools like ELK Stack, Fluentd. Provides logs about sessions, requests, responses and etc.

SSO, Authorization
A non-standard Ingress feature, added by Gateway API. It allows API access control using authentication tools like OAuth or JWT. Also stores authorized session keys to provide Single Sing-On.

Request Validation
A less popular feature that verifies API requests according to the OpenAPI schema. It pairs well with auto-generating schemas.

Response Caching
Caches responses for particular responses to increase effeciency. Already implemented in a simple form in Nginx.

Modular Deployment of Models
Supports the deployment of various machine learning (ML) models written in different programming languages and using various frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, etc.).

Containerization
Enables packaging of ML models into containers using Docker. Generates a class with ML functions. Configured using CRD (Custom Resource Definition).

Service Deployment
Automates the deployment of models from specialized repositories and version control systems into Kubernetes clusters using standard Kubernetes objects (Deployments, Services, Pods).

Model Auto-Documentation
Generates OpenAPI specifications for models by describing them during deployment from resource fields (CRD) or by reading the source code (class description) of the containerized application. Provide only chosen frameworks with brief description

# Request
Consider MVP must be developed within 2 days in a small team, having skills only in Python or maybe Golang. Provide only 2 frameworks which fits team the best for current project. You can replace one of chosen before, if you think it necessary. Mind that only one framework will be used to implement a project. Provide only chosen frameworks with a brief description.

# Response
For a small team skilled in Python or Golang, and given the tight timeline to develop an MVP, the following two frameworks would be the most fitting:

---

### 1. **FastAPI (Python)**  
   - **Why**: Extremely fast to develop with, thanks to its automatic OpenAPI schema generation and built-in request validation. It has minimal setup overhead and is easy for Python developers to adopt.  
   - **Key Features**:  
     - OpenAPI support out of the box.  
     - Built-in tools for request validation and response serialization.  
     - Asynchronous support for high-performance APIs.  
     - Ideal for quickly building modular, self-documenting API layers.  

---

### 2. **Kong (Golang-friendly)**  
   - **Why**: A Kubernetes-native API Gateway with robust features and a minimal learning curve for API management. It integrates well with Kubernetes Ingress and supports declarative configuration for rapid deployment.  
   - **Key Features**:  
     - OpenAPI integration for schema validation and documentation.  
     - Plugin support for SSO (OAuth/JWT) and caching.  
     - Can act as both ingress and API Gateway in Kubernetes.  

---

Both frameworks cater to rapid development and are manageable for a small Python or Golang team. **FastAPI** is recommended if Python expertise is dominant, as it allows direct development of the API Gateway. **Kong** is better suited if leveraging an existing API Gateway with Kubernetes-native capabilities is the goal.

# Request
For these frameworks create implementation of a microservice program representing custom Kubernetes operator for answering "Hello world!" to any client connected. Write only source code for the program.

# Response
Below are the source code implementations for the custom Kubernetes operator using **FastAPI** (Python) and **Kong** (Golang-friendly, via its declarative configuration).

---

### **FastAPI Implementation (Python)**  

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from kubernetes import client, config
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse

app = FastAPI()

# Load Kubernetes configuration (assumes in-cluster configuration)
config.load_incluster_config()

# Define a Kubernetes CRD for the operator
CRD_GROUP = "example.com"
CRD_VERSION = "v1"
CRD_PLURAL = "hellos"
NAMESPACE = "default"

@app.get("/")
async def hello_world():
    return {"message": "Hello, world!"}

@app.on_event("startup")
async def setup_crd():
    """Ensure the CRD is registered."""
    api = client.ApiextensionsV1Api()
    crd = client.V1CustomResourceDefinition(
        metadata=client.V1ObjectMeta(name="hellos.example.com"),
        spec=client.V1CustomResourceDefinitionSpec(
            group=CRD_GROUP,
            versions=[client.V1CustomResourceDefinitionVersion(
                name=CRD_VERSION,
                served=True,
                storage=True
            )],
            scope="Namespaced",
            names=client.V1CustomResourceDefinitionNames(
                plural=CRD_PLURAL,
                singular="hello",
                kind="Hello",
                shortNames=["hw"]
            )
        )
    )
    try:
        api.create_custom_resource_definition(crd)
    except client.exceptions.ApiException as e:
        if e.status != 409:
            raise

@app.get("/crd")
async def list_custom_hellos():
    """List all custom resources of kind 'Hello'."""
    api = client.CustomObjectsApi()
    hellos = api.list_namespaced_custom_object(
        group=CRD_GROUP,
        version=CRD_VERSION,
        namespace=NAMESPACE,
        plural=CRD_PLURAL
    )
    return JSONResponse(content=hellos)
```

### **Kong Implementation (Declarative Configuration)**  

For Kong, the implementation involves setting up the Gateway with a declarative configuration to respond to a "Hello, world!" message. The service and route configuration act as the microservice operator.

#### Kong Declarative Configuration (YAML)

```yaml
_format_version: "3.0"
services:
  - name: hello-world-service
    url: http://localhost:8080 # Your backend service URL
    routes:
      - name: hello-world-route
        paths:
          - /hello
        strip_path: false
        methods:
          - GET
```

#### Backend Service (Optional in Go)  

If a simple backend is needed to respond with "Hello, world!":

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"net/http"
)

func helloWorldHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	fmt.Fprintf(w, `{"message": "Hello, world!"}`)
}

func main() {
	http.HandleFunc("/", helloWorldHandler)
	http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}
```

The **FastAPI** version is fully standalone and handles Kubernetes CRD creation, while the **Kong** configuration focuses on integrating with Kubernetes-native routing and ingress mechanisms.

### **Comparison**  

| **Aspect**              | **FastAPI**                                                   | **Kong**                                                       |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Ease of Setup**        | Requires coding the entire operator logic (CRD management).  | Declarative configuration makes it simpler and faster.         |
| **Development Speed**    | Moderate: More custom coding required.                      | High: Pre-built API Gateway features speed up development.     |
| **Flexibility**          | Full control over API behavior and customizations.          | Limited to what the configuration and plugins allow.           |
| **Kubernetes Integration** | Deep integration via Python Kubernetes SDK.                | Strong with existing ingress and routing capabilities.          |
| **Performance**          | Lightweight with minimal dependencies.                      | Slight overhead with Kong as a proxy layer.                    |
| **Team Skills**          | Ideal for a Python-skilled team.                            | Better if Golang familiarity exists but not critical.           |
| **Scalability**          | Requires scaling the service explicitly.                    | Highly scalable by design due to Kong's architecture.          |
| **Extensibility**        | Can easily add custom logic, validations, and features.      | Extensible through plugins but less customizable than code.    |

### **Recommendation**  

#### **When to Choose FastAPI**  
- **You have Python expertise**: If the team is comfortable with Python, FastAPI is a better fit due to its Pythonic syntax and ability to integrate directly with Kubernetes (CRD creation, API handling).  
- **You need full control**: FastAPI allows for greater customization of API behavior, making it ideal for custom operator logic or unique requirements.  

#### **When to Choose Kong**  
- **You prioritize speed**: Kong's declarative configuration is faster to set up and deploy, which aligns well with the two-day MVP timeline.  
- **Existing Kubernetes environment**: Kong excels when working with existing Kubernetes ingress or service mesh setups, reducing the development effort.

---

### **Final Pick**: **Kong**  

Given the **tight timeline** and need for rapid deployment, **Kong** is the better choice. Its declarative nature simplifies development, and its built-in capabilities (e.g., routing, authentication, response handling) reduce coding effort significantly. However, if the team is primarily Python-oriented and flexibility/custom logic is critical, **FastAPI** is still a solid alternative.
