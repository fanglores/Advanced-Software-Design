1. You are an expert software engineer and architect. Suggest {number_of_frameworks} microservice frameworks from {git_url/list_of_frameworks} that correspond the following project the best. {project_description}. It has features {features_list}. Consider that the developers team focus on {programming_language}. Only propose frameworks.

2. Justify your choice of the frameworks {frameworks from 1st answer}

3. For these {number_of_frameworks} frameworks {promt_1_answer} create implementation of a microservice program for answering "Hello world!" to any client connected. Use any single API call for each of {number_of_frameworks} microservices from OpenAPI schema {api_schema_1}. Write only source code for the program.

4. Compare implementations for these two frameworks.
