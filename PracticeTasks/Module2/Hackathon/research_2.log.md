# Request 
Suggest 4 microservice frameworks from provided md that correspond the following project the best. Self-documenting API gateway. A typical ingress implementation in k8s forwards incoming traffic to a particular application. An improved API Gateway would integrate Single Sign-On, automatic OpenAPI schema generation, request validation and response caching. The goal of the project is to develop such a Kubernetes operator to extend existing ingress implementations to API Gateway. The project should provide means to define API schema using Custom Resource Definitions in K8s directly and generate them from the source code following a set of conventions.. It has features Request Routing
The basic function of K8s Ingress. A reverse proxy directs external traffic to the required specific K8s services.

Load Balancing
Kubernetes handles it natively using K8s Services, but not via Ingress. Typically configured with weight-based settings.

Audit, Logging
Extension of basic Nginx logging. Future integration with log storage and rotation tools like ELK Stack, Fluentd. Provides logs about sessions, requests, responses and etc.

SSO, Authorization
A non-standard Ingress feature, added by Gateway API. It allows API access control using authentication tools like OAuth or JWT. Also stores authorized session keys to provide Single Sing-On.

Request Validation
A less popular feature that verifies API requests according to the OpenAPI schema. It pairs well with auto-generating schemas.

Response Caching
Caches responses for particular responses to increase effeciency. Already implemented in a simple form in Nginx.

Modular Deployment of Models
Supports the deployment of various machine learning (ML) models written in different programming languages and using various frameworks (TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, etc.).

Containerization
Enables packaging of ML models into containers using Docker. Generates a class with ML functions. Configured using CRD (Custom Resource Definition).

Service Deployment
Automates the deployment of models from specialized repositories and version control systems into Kubernetes clusters using standard Kubernetes objects (Deployments, Services, Pods).

Model Auto-Documentation
Generates OpenAPI specifications for models by describing them during deployment from resource fields (CRD) or by reading the source code (class description) of the containerized application. Provide only chosen frameworks with brief description

# Response
Here are four microservice frameworks from the provided list that align with your project's requirements of an improved API Gateway with Kubernetes integration:

1. **Dapr**  
   - **Description**: An open-source, portable runtime for building distributed applications. It supports service invocation, state management, and pub/sub messaging, making it a good choice for modular deployments. Dapr integrates well with Kubernetes and provides extensibility for API schema validation and caching.
   - **Fit**: Offers extensibility for API gateway-like features and native Kubernetes compatibility.

2. **Spring Cloud Gateway**  
   - **Description**: A Java-based API Gateway on top of Spring MVC. It provides flexible routing, easy integration with authentication protocols (e.g., OAuth2, SSO), and request/response transformation.
   - **Fit**: Strong focus on APIs with OpenAPI documentation support, ideal for your SSO and validation needs.

3. **Kong**  
   - **Description**: An open-source, scalable API Gateway built on NGINX. It supports plugins for SSO, request validation, caching, and OpenAPI schema auto-generation, making it extensible for your project.
   - **Fit**: Highly extensible and performant with existing Kubernetes ingress integrations.

4. **Traefik**  
   - **Description**: A modern reverse proxy and load balancer. Designed for simplicity and Kubernetes-native workflows, Traefik integrates directly with CRDs and supports middleware for routing, authentication, and caching.
   - **Fit**: CRD support and Kubernetes-native architecture align perfectly with your operator's goals.

These frameworks support modularity, Kubernetes integration, and API gateway functionalities, fulfilling your project's requirements.

# Request 
Consider MVP must be developed within 2 days in a small team, having skills only in Python or maybe Golang. Provide only 2 frameworks which fits team the best for current project. You can replace one of chosen before, if you think it necessary. Mind that only one framework will be used to implement a project. Provide only chosen frameworks with a brief description.

# Response
For a small team with skills in Python or Go and a tight deadline, here are two frameworks that fit your project best, considering ease of use, compatibility, and rapid development potential:

### 1. **FastAPI (Python)**  
   - **Description**: A modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python. FastAPI supports OpenAPI schema generation out of the box and provides built-in tools for request validation. It's simple to deploy with Kubernetes, making it an excellent choice for rapid prototyping and building an API Gateway with features like SSO and caching.

### 2. **Traefik (Go)**  
   - **Description**: A Kubernetes-native reverse proxy and load balancer designed for microservices. It has seamless CRD support for Kubernetes and integrates easily with authentication and caching middleware. Traefikâ€™s declarative configuration simplifies deployment, aligning well with operator-focused projects.

Both frameworks offer simplicity and speed for MVP development, but **FastAPI** may be more suitable for Python-heavy teams, while **Traefik** is better for Go-skilled developers and Kubernetes-centric workflows.

# Request
For these frameworks create implementation of a microservice program representing custom Kubernetes operator for answering "Hello world!" to any client connected. Write only source code for the program.

# Response
### **FastAPI Implementation (Python)**

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from kubernetes import client, config, watch

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
async def read_root():
    return {"message": "Hello, world!"}

# Kubernetes Operator logic
def create_operator():
    config.load_incluster_config()
    v1 = client.CoreV1Api()
    w = watch.Watch()

    print("Starting operator...")
    for event in w.stream(v1.list_namespaced_pod, namespace="default"):
        pod_name = event['object'].metadata.name
        print(f"Event: {event['type']} Pod: {pod_name}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import uvicorn
    from multiprocessing import Process

    # Run the operator in a separate process
    operator_process = Process(target=create_operator)
    operator_process.start()

    # Start the FastAPI app
    uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)

    # Stop the operator process when the app stops
    operator_process.join()
```

---

### **Traefik Implementation (Go)**

```go
package main

import (
	"context"
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"net/http"
	"os"
	"os/signal"
	"syscall"

	"github.com/labstack/echo/v4"
	"k8s.io/client-go/kubernetes"
	"k8s.io/client-go/rest"
	"k8s.io/apimachinery/pkg/watch"
)

func main() {
	// Start Echo HTTP server
	e := echo.New()
	e.GET("/", func(c echo.Context) error {
		return c.JSON(http.StatusOK, map[string]string{"message": "Hello, world!"})
	})

	go func() {
		if err := e.Start(":8000"); err != nil && err != http.ErrServerClosed {
			log.Fatalf("Shutting down the server: %v", err)
		}
	}()

	// Start Kubernetes operator
	go func() {
		config, err := rest.InClusterConfig()
		if err != nil {
			log.Fatalf("Error building Kubernetes config: %v", err)
		}
		clientset, err := kubernetes.NewForConfig(config)
		if err != nil {
			log.Fatalf("Error creating Kubernetes client: %v", err)
		}

		watcher, err := clientset.CoreV1().Pods("").Watch(context.TODO(), rest.ListOptions{})
		if err != nil {
			log.Fatalf("Error starting watch: %v", err)
		}

		ch := watcher.ResultChan()
		log.Println("Starting operator...")
		for event := range ch {
			fmt.Printf("Event: %v\n", event.Type)
		}
	}()

	// Graceful shutdown
	quit := make(chan os.Signal, 1)
	signal.Notify(quit, os.Interrupt, syscall.SIGTERM)
	<-quit
	log.Println("Shutting down server...")
	e.Shutdown(context.Background())
}
``` 

Both implementations create a minimal "Hello, world!" API with basic Kubernetes operator functionality to watch for Pod events in the cluster. Choose **FastAPI** for Python expertise or **Traefik (using Echo)** for Go expertise.
