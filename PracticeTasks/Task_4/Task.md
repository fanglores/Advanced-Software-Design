#Task 4  

Solve static modeling tasks using UML2 and ER diagrams.

The first student who solves a task, consults the professor, and if the solution is OK, writes down the solution on the whiteboard and receives an individual point.

NOTE: Each task contains many bullets. You have to solve all of them before presenting the solution.

NOTE: Write down a model of task statement first, then add only that has been changed to solve each bullet.

Each team with at least one member who got an individual point gets a project point.

Each team that submits all six tasks solved using the chosen modeling tools gets a project point.

There are a total of six tasks.
