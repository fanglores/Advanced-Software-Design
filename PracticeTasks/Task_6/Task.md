# Task 6  

Develop an interaction model for your product. Use use cases from Task 5 and apply CRC modeling technique to devise collaborations and interaction sequences.

Overall process:
Make a list of high priority Use Cases and candidate classes
Apply a CRC role-playing method to elaborate class interactions within the system. Write down the responsibilities of each participating class. Introduce new classes/roles whenever necessary.
Build a cooperations table to indicate which classes participate in which use cases. Update class diagram if needed
Check that DDD stereotypes are up to date.

NOTE: try to follow “know, do, interact” classification of responsibilities at step 2

NOTE: when preparing a talk on a task, consider justifying the design and providing rationale instead of just retelling what is already shown in the slides/repo.

HINT: do not consider user interface as part of the doman, avoid ‘form’, ‘screen’ classes. Think of API.

HINT: You may wish to use GRASP responsibility patterns to justify your design decisions.
