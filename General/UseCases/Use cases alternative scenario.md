## 1. Request Routing
- **Alternative Scenario: Unknown Route**
    1. The API Consumer sends a request to the API Gateway.
    2. The API Gateway does not find a corresponding route for the request.
    3. The API Gateway returns an error message (404 Not Found) to the API Consumer.

## 2. Load Balancing
- **Alternative Scenario: Temporary Instance Shutdown**
    1. The API Consumer sends a request to the API Gateway.
    2. One of the service instances is temporarily unavailable (e.g., undergoing maintenance).
    3. The API Gateway redirects requests to available instances.
    4. If all instances are unavailable, it returns an error message (503 Service Unavailable).

## 3. Audit and Logging
- **Alternative Scenario: Error in Logging**
    1. A request enters the API Gateway.
    2. The API Gateway successfully processes the request, but an error occurs while attempting to log the data.
    3. The API Gateway continues processing the request but notifies the DevOps Engineer about the logging issue.

## 4. SSO (Single Sign-On) and Authorization
- **Alternative Scenario: Login Using Third-Party Provider**
    1. The API Consumer sends a request to access a protected resource.
    2. The API Gateway detects the absence of an authorization token.
    3. The user is redirected to the login page of a third-party provider (e.g., Google, Facebook).
    4. After a successful login, the user is redirected back to the API Gateway with a token.

## 5. Request Validation
- **Alternative Scenario: Access Issue with OpenAPI Schema**
    1. The API Consumer sends a request to the API Gateway.
    2. The API Gateway attempts to validate the request but cannot access the OpenAPI schema.
    3. The request is rejected with an error message indicating validation issues.

## 6. Response Caching
- **Alternative Scenario: Request with Unique Parameters**
    1. The API Consumer sends a request to the API Gateway with specific parameters.
    2. The response is not cached since the request parameters are unique (e.g., requests to a model with different data).
    3. The API Gateway processes the request and returns the response without caching it.

## 7. Modular Deployment of Models
- **Alternative Scenario: Model Update**
    1. The ML Engineer uploads a new version of the model to the repository.
    2. The API Gateway initiates the update process, replacing the old model with the new one.
    3. A new version of the service is automatically created, and the old version continues to process requests until the update is completed.

## 8. Containerization
- **Alternative Scenario: Error in Dockerfile**
    1. The ML Engineer uploads the model code to the repository.
    2. The API Gateway attempts to containerize the model but encounters an error in the Dockerfile.
    3. The containerization process stops, and the ML Engineer is notified of the error for resolution.

## 9. Service Deployment
- **Alternative Scenario: Version Conflict**
    1. The ML Engineer attempts to deploy a new version of the model that conflicts with the currently deployed version.
    2. The API Gateway prevents the deployment from completing and notifies the ML Engineer of the conflict.
    3. The ML Engineer receives a notification to resolve the conflict before proceeding.

## 10. Model Auto-Documentation
- **Alternative Scenario: Incomplete Documentation**
    1. The ML Engineer deploys a model via the API Gateway.
    2. The documentation generation occurs, but some details cannot be extracted (e.g., part of the comments in the code is missing).
    3. The documentation is created, but the API Consumer is notified that the information may be incomplete.
