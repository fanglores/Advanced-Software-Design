* Preconditions:
	* Multiple instances of a service are running in the Kubernetes cluster.
	* Load balancing rules are configured (e.g., Round-Robin).
* Main Success Scenario:
	1. API Consumer sends a request to the API Gateway.
	2. The API Gateway distributes the request across available service instances using the predefined load balancing algorithm (e.g., Round-Robin).
	3. The selected Kubernetes service instance processes the request.
	4. The service sends the response back to the API Gateway.
	5. The API Gateway returns the response to the API Consumer.
* Postconditions:
	* Requests are balanced across multiple service instances, and responses are successfully delivered to the API Consumer.
* Failure Conditions:
	* No healthy service instances are available.
	* Misconfiguration in load balancing rules.

* Actors:
    * API Consumer
    * Security Specialist
* Preconditions:
    * The SSO system is integrated with the API Gateway.
    * User credentials and authorization tokens (e.g., JWT, OAuth) are stored.
* Main Success Scenario:
    1. API Consumer sends a request to access a protected resource.
    2. The API Gateway checks the authorization token (JWT/OAuth) associated with the request.
    3. If the token is valid, the gateway forwards the authorized request to the appropriate service.
    4. If the token is invalid or expired, the user is redirected to the SSO login page.
    5. Upon successful login, the session is stored for future requests.
* Postconditions:
    * The user is authenticated and authorized, and the session is maintained for subsequent requests.
* Failure Conditions:
    * The authorization token has expired or is invalid.
    * Unauthorized access is attempted without a valid session or token.

## 5. Request Validation
* Actors:
    * API Consumer
    * DevOps Engineer
* Preconditions:
    * An OpenAPI schema is generated and integrated with the API Gateway for request validation.
* Main Success Scenario:
    1. API Consumer sends a request to the API Gateway.
    2. The API Gateway validates the request against the OpenAPI schema.
    3. If the request conforms to the schema, it is forwarded to the appropriate Kubernetes service.
    4. If the request is invalid, the API Gateway returns an error response to the API Consumer.
* Postconditions:
    * Only valid requests are forwarded to the services in the Kubernetes cluster.
* Failure Conditions:
    * The request does not conform to the OpenAPI schema, and an error response is generated.

## 6. Response Caching
* Actors:
    * API Consumer
    * DevOps Engineer
* Preconditions:
    * Caching is enabled for specific responses in the API Gateway.
* Main Success Scenario:
    1. API Consumer sends a request to the API Gateway.
    2. The API Gateway checks if a cached response for the request is available.
    3. If the response is cached, the gateway serves the cached response to the API Consumer.
    4. If the response is not cached, the request is processed by the Kubernetes service, and the response is cached for future requests.
* Postconditions:
    * Response time is reduced for future requests that hit the cache.
* Failure Conditions:
    * Cache miss (no cached data available for the request).
    * Cached data is outdated or invalid.
