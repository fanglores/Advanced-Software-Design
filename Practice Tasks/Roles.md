## Roles
The Gateway API being developed is intended for third-party clients and will be distributed as a library. Our product solves tasks for several roles at once. Initially, we focused on the implementation of Single Sign-On (SSO), which is important for system architects who simplify the management of authentication and interaction of multiple services. Then we added features to help DevOps engineers with centralized request management through the API Gateway, including validation and caching. We also took into account the needs of developers by automating the API documentation process to facilitate their work.

##
### System architect
