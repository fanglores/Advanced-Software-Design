# Task 5  

Develop an analysis model for your product. Use features and stories from Task 3 as a source of requirements.

Optional extra: discuss, explain and get feedback on your requirements from the HSE MLOps team or AI Center Framework team (your customers).

Overall process:

1. Detail use cases for job/user stories.  
  A rule of thumb: function/user level Use case <=> user/job story in product (business) requirements
2. Build a Glossary of candidate classes with either Abbot’s methods, checklists or both based on use cases, stories, features. Check for duplicates
3. Use “SIAOUT” criteria to classify them as attributes, classes, values. Extract operations and relations as verbs and/or communication/interaction acts.
4. Draw a draft class model from 2. and 3.
5. Assign DDD stereotypes to classes from 4.

NOTE: steps 1 and 2 may come in parallel

HINT: you may spot generalization at this step, use it sparingly, check that it is not coincidental / or specific to a particular context.

NOTE: keep your repo up to date with task reports
