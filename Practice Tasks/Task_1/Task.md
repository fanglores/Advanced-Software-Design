# Task 1  

Form a team, come up with a name for the team.

Select tools for the team to develop a software product:
Repo (n.b. Github may ban)
Task tracker 
Wiki/docs storage
Team chat
Modeling tool (see https://tiny.cc/asd-tools)

Everyone must agree on the tools. You will use the tools for tasks in Module 1.

Write on the blackboard and send to the course chat: team name, members, tools.

Make tools 1-3 accessible to teachers and all course students. If you have a link to another team's project DO NOT SEND it to anyone.
