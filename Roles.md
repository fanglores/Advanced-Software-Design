## Roles
The Gateway API being developed is intended for third-party clients and will be distributed as a library. Our product solves tasks for several roles at once. Initially, we focused on the implementation of Single Sign-On (SSO), which is important for system architects who simplify the management of authentication and interaction of multiple services. Then we added features to help DevOps engineers with centralized request management through the API Gateway, including validation and caching. We also took into account the needs of developers by automating the API documentation process to facilitate their work.

### System architect
Role description: System architect manages complex infrastructure taking responsibility for integration part of various services and systems, as well as their scalability and security.

**Responsibilities:**
- Implementation of Single Sign-On (SSO) for unified authentication in all services, providing security and convenience for users.
- Simplify the interaction between services, ensuring their seamless integration and resistance to change.

**Reasons to buy product:**
- Improving system security through centralized authentication.
- Simplify architecture management and integration of various service.

### DevOps-engineer
Role description: DevOps-engineer is responsible for process automation, deployment and infrastructure support, including performance optimization and scalability of services.

**Responsibilities:**
- Centralized management of incoming traffic via API Gateway, including routing, request validation and caching to reduce the load on services and improve their performance.
- API Gateway integration with Kubernetes for network traffic optimizations and services scalability.

**Reasons to buy product:**
- Improve efficiency/performance metrics and infrastructure reliability.
- Performance optimization through response caching and validation.

### Developer
Role description: Developer is focused on building and maintaining application, APIs and providing their functionality. It's important for him to automate routine tasks and provide up-to-date documentation for ease of support.

**Responsibilities:**
- Automation of API documentation generation which facilitates the process of updating and maintaining documentation in accordance with changes made in the code.
- Ensuring API compliance with established standards and maintaining the relevance of schemes through automatic tools.

**Reasons to buy product:**
- Reduce time spent on support and documentation updates.
- Improve efficiency by automating routine tasks related to documentation.
